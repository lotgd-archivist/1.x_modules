Collection(s) of lotgd 1.x modules.

# Sources

## Anpera

[Modules](./anpera/) obtained from the german language anpera.net community forum. These were manually catalogued and downloaded by me.

## Shinobi Legends

A collection of [modules](./shinobi_legends/) thankfully provided to me by the administrator of [Shinobi Legends](https://shinobilegends.com/home.php?) Nightborn / Oliver Brendel.

I had not yet have the opportunity to compare this collection against the DragonPrime: Reborn collection. As it is now, it is just an uncurated mirror of what Nightborn had at hand.

I obtained this collection on 2022-05-18. Thank you very much, Nightborn!

## DragonPrime: Reborn

Modules from the download provided by [DragonPrime: Reborn](https://dragonprime-reborn.ca/), who have spend a lot of time reconstructing the old dragon prime module repository.

**Modules](./dragonprime_reborn/) to be added.**
