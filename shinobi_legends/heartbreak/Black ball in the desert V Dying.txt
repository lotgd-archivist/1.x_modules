Black gets blurry
hard mass becoming liquid
dropping away
slowly on the ground.

As as things end
these do too
quietly
releasing the pressure.

Thick black drops go down
melt the rifts of glass
seeping into
the consciousness.

When all is gone
the snakes the black the ball
a small fire remains
a spark.

Maybe that was all it wanted to do
become, be, incite something.
Some things shatter
some things resolve.

Whatever there is
Whenever there is again
However it will be
the Light of Dawn.
