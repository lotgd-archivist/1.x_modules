Greater Darkness in the Desert

Days have past
hours gone by under the sky
only the wind moves the sand
and things evolved

Hard like a diamant
the nothingness has become
it merged into the inner self
became fused with the land

Though it is black
and black mostly means evil
plants began do grow anew
bringing back a bit of green

The water was gone
so there only was one source
the one hidden inside
the nothingness

The land has changed
it slowly grows again
and the nothingness
engulfs is a part of it each day

What is inside
hidden within
the round black
nothingness

What will become of the land
is still unknown
but the darkness
is welcome once more

Whatever it will bring
its presence
already did something
to the whole being itself

Lets at least enjoy the time
the new green grows
if it decides to end it all
that's the least to do
