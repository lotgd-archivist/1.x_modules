Long lost desert
stretching out under the sky
nothing can be felt
nothing can be heard

That's what is inside me
though the desert is not empty
right in the middle
is a round black nothingness

Once there was a haven
green and fresh and lively
it did not last long
faded like an illusion

Those few days were cherished
incredible times flew by
the best place on earth
right there in the middle

Happiness is given for the moment
or so they say
and these few moments
were the greatest of all

Now there is this nothingness
waiting for the earth to go dry
so it may consume and swallow
all of this once wonderful feeling
