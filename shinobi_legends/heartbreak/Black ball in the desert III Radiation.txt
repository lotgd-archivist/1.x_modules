The nothingness did not move
nor did the air
nor did the green
but it got hot.

The sand turned to glass
the ball sent out waves
of terrible heat
because it could not bear it any longer.

It was not the ball
the ball meant protection
from what was dwelling
inside.

Though nothing moved
more and more turned to glass
like in a castle
shining and cold.

Emotions were trapped inside
like serpents
mingling and hissing at each other
fighting to be the dominant one.

That energy produced was lethal
and it seems
the nothingness cannot hold it
forever.

Cracks appear on the surface
something oozes out
it hurts
and more changes.

Every green struggles to survive
tries to adapt
tries to bend
will it live on?

I doubt anybody could approach it
invisible waves pushing them back
searing pain in their eyes
they have to turn back.

Will it break?
Will it explode?
What will happen when it can't go on
what feeling will survive?
