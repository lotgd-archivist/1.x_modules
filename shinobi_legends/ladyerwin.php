/*

This module is dedicated to my beloved rat, Lady Erwin. She was put to sleep on 1st of August 2005. She had three large tumors, wasn't able to walk normally and had a fever too. I am still sad about this, and so I tried to write something for her. After that poem, I thought about this module.


Oliver

V1.01 added the feed operation
V1.02 added the kick operation
V1.03 added some buff settings
V1.04 fixed some grammar and punctuation mistakes, big thanks to Elessa :-)
V1.05 fixed the permanent/temporary hp matter
v1.06 added one pref for the kick and mr. black
