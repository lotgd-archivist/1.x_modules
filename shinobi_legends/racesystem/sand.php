Many people from all across the land mingle as Bertold, a strapping man with a wind-weathered face, extols the virtues of each of the creatures in his care.  After a certain war incident, Bertold, who lived all his life in Wind Country, was forced to re-open his business in Water Country. `n`nAs you approach, Bertold smiles broadly, \"`^Ahh! how can I help you today?`6\" he asks in a booming voice.",
